# MCF-across-Canada
Methane conversion factors were calculated with 3403 weather stations based on the 2019 IPCC Refinement method

This repo is a supplementary for the manuscript "Evaluating the 2019 IPCC Refinement for estimating Methane Conversion Factors in Canada". The authors are Chih-Yu Hung, Andrew VanderZaag, Smith Ward, and Brian Grant, who are affiliated to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

Users need to download the files to the same folder and change the directory in the "Methane conversion factor calculation". In this file, I demonstrated how to calculate MCF under five scenarios including different climate conditions, removal scenarios, emptying efficiencies, minimum temperatures, damping factors. The results are identical to our examples in the supplementary material.  

A MCF app developed with shinyR can be used to calculate MCF
